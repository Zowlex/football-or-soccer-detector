===================================>[Test here !](https://football-soccer-detector.onrender.com)<==================================

This is my first machine learning app for [this classifier](https://github.com/Zowlex/fastai_coursev3_lesson1) where I got inspired from 
[Simon Willison](https://github.com/simonw) project [cougar-or-not](https://github.com/simonw/cougar-or-not) and made my own web app
using an ASGI framework that shines :star2: :star2: [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) :star2: :star2: .

### Details:
1. After checking my model's accuracy and finetuning I saved it stage2.pth and exported it for deployement export.pkl
2. Created detect.py and tested it locally

and the result was a simple json document.
